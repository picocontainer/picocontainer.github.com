Leveraging Parameter Namesp. This is where the type alone is not enough to indicate which dependency should be put one or more constructor args. The following component has a need for two of the same type, with some subtly different characteristics.

public class AppleProcessor { private Apple dessertApple; private Apple cookingApple; public inject(Apple dessertApple, Apple cookingApple) { this.dessertApple = dessertApple; this.cookingApple = cookingApple; } // other methods } pico.addComponent("dessertApple", GoldenDeliciousApple.class); pico.addComponent("cookingApple", BramleyApple.class); pico.as(Characteristics.USE_NAMES).addComponent(AppleProcessor.class); AppleProcessor appleProcessor = pico.getComponent(AppleProcessor.class);p. In this case the constructor to AppleProcessor has carefully named parameters - 'dessertApple' and 'cookingApple'. This is picked up on for the two named components GoldenDeliciousApple and BramleyApple also set up in the container.

p. There are two ways for this to work:

* relying on the fact that your component classes have debug info compiled into them.
* post-processing component classes with "Paranamer":http://paranamer.codehaus.org/ before placing them in their jar
