h3. PicoContainer Core

p.  "PicoContainer Core":javadoc/core/index.html contains the fundamental functionality of PicoContainer

h3. PicoContainer Gems

p.  "Gems":javadoc/gems/index.html contains value-added Injectors, Containers, Monitors, and Parameters that often require additional dependencies to support each behavior.

p(small). Note: Gems is designed so that you need to only import the dependencies needed for a given feature you need. For example, CommonsLoggingComponentMonitor only requires the Apache Commons Logging project. You don't have to import the Servlet API to use it.

h3. PicoContainer TCK

p. The "TCK":javadoc/tck/index.html is a test suite to allow you to create and verify your own PicoContainer-based solutions.
