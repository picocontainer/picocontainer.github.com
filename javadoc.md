## PicoContainer Core

[PicoContainer Core](javadoc/core/index.html) contains the fundamental functionality of PicoContainer

## PicoContainer Gems

[Gems](javadoc/gems/index.html) contains value-added Injectors, Containers, Monitors, and Parameters that often require additional dependencies to support each behavior.

Note: Gems is designed so that you need to only import the dependencies needed for a given feature you need. For example, CommonsLoggingComponentMonitor only requires the Apache Commons Logging project. You don't have to import the Servlet API to use it.

## PicoContainer TCK

The [TCK](javadoc/tck/index.html) is a test suite to allow you to create and verify your own PicoContainer-based solutions.
