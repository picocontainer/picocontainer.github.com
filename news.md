-   Adapter.findAdapterofType() null handling improved

## Jan 20, 2009 - PicoContainer 2.7 released (278K jar)

### New (since 2.6):

-   Provider added as a type of Injector. Subclasses of this supply one method called provide that takes dependencies and returns an instance of the type it is trying to provide
-   ComponentMonitor: new method newBehavior
-   ReflectionMethodInjection: new annotation @Nullable allows for individual parameters to be null
-   Guarding behavior : before components are injected, another seeming unrelated can be injected too and veto if it sees fit

### Changes (versus 2.6):

-   Method decorateComponentInstance on Injector changed to have a return value
-   Scoped components stored in ThreadLocal can now can honor lifecycle concepts reliably

### Changes (versus 2.5.1):

-   Permissions fix for AdaptingInjection

## Aug 14, 2008 - PicoContainer 2.5.1 released (255K jar)

### Changes (versus 2.5):

-   makeChildContainer passes componentMonitor to the child container.

### New (since 2.4):

-   Circular dependencies, while always supported via the implementation hiding behavior are now supported explicitly for individual components
-   PicoBuilder improved in that it can add child containers to their parents if wanted. Refer PicoBuilder.addChildToParent()
-   Components can now declare generic collections as dependencies to be Injected. It works the same was as an Array of the type in question always did.
-   Concrete extensions of generic components can satisfy dependencies now. This is *a* way of beating type erasure.

### Changes (versus 2.4):

-   ConsoleComponentMonitor does need to be final, thus is not now.
-   Attempts to chain a series of MutablePicoContainer.as() statements are blocked now. Instead users are directed towards the varargs feature of the same method.

## June 26, 2008 - PicoContainer 2.4 released (253K jar)

## May 9, 2008 - PicoContainer 2.2 released (224K jar)

### New (since 2.1):

-   A new TieringPicoContainer that when used in a container tree, forbids children from seeking dependencies from their grandparents (they can only seek such from their parents)
-   A new ReusablePicoContainer that is 2.5x faster for some niche usages where you are repeatedly discarding a container and then repopulating it (Gems)
-   NamedFieldInjection allows named fields to be injected into (per component) - use when AnnotatedFieldInjection is not what you want
-   TypedFieldInjection allows fields of a specified type to be injected into (per component) - use when AnnotatedFieldInjection is not what you want
-   CompositeInjection allows a very custom setup of what injection-types you want your instance to support. Use when speed of execution is of the essence and AdaptiveInjection is not right for you.
-   Decorating (behavior factory) - do something to a component instance immediately after its instantiation (and formal injection)
-   FactoryAdapter - Allows for a custom instance to be injected into a component. E.g. 'new Logger(Foo.class)' for a Logger type and a Foo instance being the injectee

### Changes (versus 2.1):

-   Teams embedding PicoContainer and (completely hiding it from user communities) can extend StartableLifecycleStrategy and provide their own Startable interface (was buggy)

- Automatic JNDI exposure
- Multi Injection (Setter and after Constructor injection)
- Store behavior (can extract/replace component store per thread)

<span class="callout">April, 2007: Work begins on PicoContainer 2.x. It is substantially a refactoring of the PicoContainer 1.x codeline using the inbuilt features of Intellij IDEA and Eclipse. Using the existing unit tests as a guide, many small commits were made to the code-base to take PicoContainer in a more JDK 1.5 direction, and add in other features not seen in competing containers like parameter name access. Along the way, the API was simplified and parts of NanoContainer were bought closer to the core of PicoContainer.</span>

PicoContainer 1.0 alpha-2 (36K jar)

Setter Injection added (this was after the Pico team learned of the Spring-Framework project, Spring did not add Constructor Injection until the run up to 1.0-Milestone-3 in November '03 and 'autowiring' in the run up to 1-0-Milestone-4 in January of '04)p. **June 29, 2003**

PicoContainer 1.0 alpha-1 (25K jar)

Generalized Constructor Injection available for the first time. This was very much PicoContainer's idiom. ATG Dynamo had something similar for web components, but Pico released this first as a general embedable API for the Java world. Goals for Pico are a) lightweight/embeddable, b) no XML or meta-data - 'autowiring' only, c) no lock-in, d) popularize Constructor Injection over Avalon and OSGi style of IoC, e) no dependencies for the container itself.
