See Martin Fowlers's [Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection patten](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) article from 2003 for a thorough description. Surely everyone has read this by now?

Very quickly: Dependency Injection is where components are given their dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly into fields. Those components do not get their dependencies themselves, or instantiate them directly. This is very much related to the encompassing design principle [Inversion of Control](inversion-of-control.html) .

## Different types of Dependency Injection supported by PicoContainer

PicoContainer supports multiple ways to specify the injection of dependencies into components. Constructor injection (listed first) is the recommended idiom for PicoContainer. Other types leverage fields and methods. Variations of the method types, can follow a naming convention or be marked with an annotation. Dependencies for those could be populated one by one, or all in one method call. Indeed components could be populated with combinations of Constructor, Method and Field Injection.
